## Metagenomics tutorial (Fa22, week of Oct 17 activity)

Some notes:
* Metadata pre-filtered to only autoFMT samples.
* ASV table and feature table already pre-filtered to autoFMT study, excluding below-level taxonomic assignments and low-frequency ASVs.
* `filtered-table.qza` corresponds to `filtered-table-4.qza` from the QIIME2 tutorial linked above.
* filtered-sequences.qza corresponds to `filtered-sequences-2.qza` from the QIIME2 tutorial linked above.
* In the future, I would prefer to use the Silva specialized/weighted classifier, but it's rather large and would increase the runtime. On the off chance that Colab gives more compute resources in the future, linked [here](https://zenodo.org/record/6395539).
